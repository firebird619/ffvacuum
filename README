ffvacuum is a simple shell script that will clean the 
sqlite3 databases that form the backend of 
Mozilla Firefox 3.

Having database store your browsing data has one drawback, 
you have to optimize the database from time to time to get 
rid of old, deleted data, re-index the columns etc. 
Otherwise you keep all the junk data mixed in with your 
real data

The idea behind this is not mine but was posted by

I just wrote the testcases and scripting around it.
